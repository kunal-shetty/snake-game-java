# Snake Game in Java

This is a classic Snake game that I built using Java to understand how game development works with Java’s graphics libraries. Working on this project helped me improve my understanding of Java fundamentals, OOP concepts, rendering, keyboard input handling, and game loop logic.

## Features

* Classic snake movement with smooth controls
* Food spawning at random positions
* Score system that increments as the snake grows
* Collision detection with walls and the snake’s own body
* Game over screen and restart option
* Lightweight 2D rendering using Java Swing or AWT
* Clean and organized object-oriented code

## What I Learned

### Game Loop in Java

I learned how to implement a real game loop using timers, repaint cycles, and consistent updates to keep the snake moving smoothly.

### Handling Keyboard Input

Working with `KeyListener` helped me understand how to capture and process user input for real-time movements.

### Rendering Graphics

I learned how to draw shapes, text, and animations using Java’s graphics classes, and how the repaint/update cycle works.

### Object-Oriented Structure

I used classes for the snake, the game panel, and the main frame, which helped me understand how to structure Java game projects cleanly.

### Collision Logic

I implemented boundary detection and self-collision logic, which gave me a better understanding of coordinates, arrays, and game rules.

### Randomization & Game States

I learned how to randomly generate food positions and how to manage states like running, paused, and game over.

## Tech Used

* Java
* Swing / AWT for UI and rendering
* Timers for the game loop
* Basic OOP and event-driven programming

## Summary

Building this Snake game taught me how to combine Java fundamentals with game development logic. It helped me understand rendering, input handling, collision detection, and overall project structure in Java. This project strengthened my confidence with Java and gave me practical experience with building interactive applications.
